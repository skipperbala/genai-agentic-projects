# GenAI + Agentic AI Portfolio Projects

A Research-driven projects that demonstrate advanced use of LLMs, multimodal AI, and autonomous agents.
 1. AutoFormulate: AI Scientist for Hypothesis Generation

**Goal:** Automatically extract and propose new research hypotheses from scientific papers (e.g., arXiv).

**Key Features:**
- LLM-driven RAG pipeline on arXiv data
- Scientific concept extraction + graph building (e.g., Neo4j)
- Agent planner that proposes new experiments or directions

**Tech Stack:** GPT-4, LangGraph, PyMuPDF, Neo4j, FastAPI
